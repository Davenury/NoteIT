### Demo Version
After setting up the server side, go to [this site](https://davenury.github.io/NoteIT/), where you can have some fun with this app.

---

### About Project
It's a simple React web application to show possibilities of NoteAPI.

---

### Getting project
Clone this repository, install packages by typing `npm install` and then type `npm start` to set it on your localhost. Please note, that if you also made a server on your localhost and you're not using repl.it (more about it at [this link](https://github.com/Davenury/Polsource_Task#run-project-demo)), you'll need to make one small change to get this work.

Go to App.js file and change variable baseURL to your server address.
